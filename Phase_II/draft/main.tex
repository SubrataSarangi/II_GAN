\title{Generative AI for Image Reconstruction with Intensity Interferometry: A First Attempt}
\date{}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In modern astronomy, simulation and observation with Intensity Interferometry (II) are showing noteworthy progress with optical wavelengths to achieve high-resolved stellar objects. Despite these achievements, phase retrieval of the signal remains challenging due to photon correlation, hence the image reconstruction. Here, we propose the application of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to II simulated data to overcome the limitations of traditional image reconstruction methods, as Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are at the forefront of revealing astronomical mysteries by analyzing the signal. Here, the cGAN effectively reconstructs the shape, size, and brightness distribution of a fast-rotating star by utilizing sparsely sampled, phase-subtracted Fourier transforms of the star. This approach is highly relevant to the existing image reconstruction technique with II and could revolutionize high-resolution imaging in astronomy. Simulations of II are based on an assembly of four telescopes similar to existing arrays. However, the sensitivity of the signal and resolution of stellar objects are expected to improve with additional baselines, which makes the current and future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) an ideal candidate for II applications.
