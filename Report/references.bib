	abstract = {With its unprecedented light-collecting area for night-sky observations, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) holds great potential for also optical stellar astronomy, in particular as a multi-element intensity interferometer for realizing imaging with sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution. Such an order-of-magnitude increase of the spatial resolution achieved in optical astronomy will reveal the surfaces of rotationally flattened stars with structures in their circumstellar disks and winds, or the gas flows between close binaries. Image reconstruction is feasible from the second-order coherence of light, measured as the temporal correlations of arrival times between photons recorded in different telescopes. This technique (once pioneered by Hanbury Brown and Twiss) connects telescopes only with electronic signals and is practically insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and to imperfections in telescope optics. Detector and telescope requirements are very similar to those for imaging air Cherenkov observatories, the main difference being the signal processing (calculating cross correlations between single camera pixels in pairs of telescopes). Observations of brighter stars are not limited by sky brightness, permitting efficient CTA use during also bright-Moon periods. While other concepts have been proposed to realize kilometer-scale optical interferometers of conventional amplitude (phase-) type, both in space and on the ground, their complexity places them much further into the future than CTA, which thus could become the first kilometer-scale optical imager in astronomy.},

This means that they are ideally suited for optical interferometry observations. Thanks to their sensitivity to visible wavelengths and long baselines optical intensity interferometry with IACTs allows reaching angular resolutions of tens to microarcseconds. We have installed a simple optical setup on top of the cameras of the two 17 m diameter Major Atmospheric Gamma-Ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) IACTs and observed coherent fluctuations in the photon intensity measured at the two telescopes for three different stars.

	abstract = {Due to their large mirror size, fast response to single photons, sensitivity and telescope baselines in the order of 100 m, Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes are ideally suited to perform intensity interferometry observations. In 2019 a test readout setup was installed in the two 17-m diameter MAGIC telescopes to allow performing interferometry measurements with them. The first on-sky measurements were able to detect correlated intensity fluctuations consistent with the stellar diameters of three different stars: Adhara (∊ CMa), Benetnasch (η UMa) and Mirzam (β CMa). After the upgrade of the setup in 2021, MAGIC is now equipped with a high-duty-cycle intensity interferometer, already in operation. A technical description of the interferometer and first performance results obtained by measuring several known stellar diameter are presented. © 2022 Sissa Medialab Srl. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {High angular resolution observations at optical wavelengths provide valuable insights into stellar astrophysics1,2, and enable direct measurements of fundamental stellar parameters3,4 and the probing of stellar atmospheres, circumstellar disks5, the elongation of rapidly rotating stars6 and the pulsations of Cepheid variable stars7. The angular size of most stars is of the order of one milliarcsecond or less, and to spatially resolve stellar disks and features at this scale requires an optical interferometer using an array of telescopes with baselines on the order of hundreds of metres. We report on the implementation of a stellar intensity interferometry system developed for the four VERITAS imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The system was used to measure the angular diameter of the two sub-milliarcsecond stars β Canis Majoris and ϵ Orionis with a precision of greater than 5\%. The system uses an offline approach in which starlight intensity fluctuations that are recorded at each telescope are correlated post observation. The technique can be readily scaled onto tens to hundreds of telescopes, providing a capability that has proven technically challenging to the current generation of optical amplitude interferometry observatories. This work demonstrates the feasibility of performing astrophysical measurements using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays as intensity interferometers and shows the promise for integrating an intensity interferometry system within future observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has garnered tremendous success in a variety of application domains. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and has been applied to most traditional application domains, as well as some new areas that present more opportunities. Different methods have been proposed based on different categories of learning, including supervised, semi-supervised, and un-supervised learning. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance using deep learning when compared to traditional machine learning approaches in the fields of image processing, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, art, medical imaging, medical information processing, robotics and control, bioinformatics, natural language processing, cybersecurity, and many others. This survey presents a brief survey on the advances that have occurred in the area of Deep Learning (DL), starting with the Deep Neural Network (DNN). The survey goes on to cover Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Additionally, we have discussed recent developments, such as advanced variant DL techniques based on these DL approaches. This work considers most of the papers published after 2012 from when the history of deep learning began. Furthermore, DL approaches that have been explored and evaluated in different application domains are also included in this survey. We also included recently developed frameworks, SDKs, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating deep learning approaches. There are some surveys that have been published on DL using neural networks and a survey on Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, those papers have not discussed individual advanced techniques for training large-scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {We present a deep learning-based generative model for the enhancement of partially coherent diffractive images. In lensless coherent diffractive imaging, a highly coherent X-ray illumination is required to image an object at high resolution. Non-ideal experimental conditions result in a partially coherent X-ray illumination, lead to imperfections of coherent diffractive images recorded on a detector, and ultimately limit the capability of lensless coherent diffractive imaging. The previous approaches, relying on the coherence property of illumination, require preliminary experiments or expensive computations. In this article, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to enhance the visibility of fringes in partially coherent diffractive images. Unlike previous approaches, the model is trained to restore the latent sharp features from blurred input images without finding coherence properties of illumination. We demonstrate that the GAN model performs well with both coherent diffractive imaging and ptychography. It can be applied to a wide range of imaging techniques relying on phase retrieval of coherent diffraction patterns. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},
