	abstract = {With its unprecedented light-collecting area for night-sky observations, the Cherenkov Telescope Array ({CTA}) holds great potential for also optical stellar astronomy, in particular as a multi-element intensity interferometer for realizing imaging with sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution. Such an order-of-magnitude increase of the spatial resolution achieved in optical astronomy will reveal the surfaces of rotationally flattened stars with structures in their circumstellar disks and winds, or the gas flows between close binaries. Image reconstruction is feasible from the second-order coherence of light, measured as the temporal correlations of arrival times between photons recorded in different telescopes. This technique (once pioneered by Hanbury Brown and Twiss) connects telescopes only with electronic signals and is practically insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and to imperfections in telescope optics. Detector and telescope requirements are very similar to those for imaging air Cherenkov observatories, the main difference being the signal processing (calculating cross correlations between single camera pixels in pairs of telescopes). Observations of brighter stars are not limited by sky brightness, permitting efficient {CTA} use during also bright-Moon periods. While other concepts have been proposed to realize kilometer-scale optical interferometers of conventional amplitude (phase-) type, both in space and on the ground, their complexity places them much further into the future than {CTA}, which thus could become the first kilometer-scale optical imager in astronomy.},

	abstract = {The Cherenkov Telescope Array ({CTA}), the new-generation ground-based observatory for γ astronomy, provides unique capabilities to address significant open questions in astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. We study some of the salient areas of γ cosmology that can be explored as part of the Key Science Projects of {CTA}, through simulated observations of active galactic nuclei ({AGN}) and of their relativistic jets. Observations of {AGN} with {CTA} will enable a measurement of γ absorption on the extragalactic background light with a statistical uncertainty below 15\% up to a redshift z=2 and to constrain or detect γ halos up to intergalactic-magnetic-field strengths of at least 0.3 {pG} . Extragalactic observations with {CTA} also show promising potential to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The best limits on Lorentz invariance violation from γ astronomy will be improved by a factor of at least two to three. {CTA} will also probe the parameter space in which axion-like particles could constitute a significant fraction, if not all, of dark matter. We conclude on the synergies between {CTA} and other upcoming facilities that will foster the growth of γ cosmology.},

This means that they are ideally suited for optical interferometry observations. Thanks to their sensitivity to visible wavelengths and long baselines optical intensity interferometry with {IACTs} allows reaching angular resolutions of tens to microarcseconds. We have installed a simple optical setup on top of the cameras of the two 17 m diameter Major Atmospheric Gamma-Ray Imaging Cherenkov ({MAGIC}) {IACTs} and observed coherent fluctuations in the photon intensity measured at the two telescopes for three different stars. The sensitivity is roughly 10 times better than that achieved in the 1970s with the Narrabri interferometer.},

	abstract = {High angular resolution observations at optical wavelengths provide valuable insights into stellar astrophysics1,2, and enable direct measurements of fundamental stellar parameters3,4 and the probing of stellar atmospheres, circumstellar disks5, the elongation of rapidly rotating stars6 and the pulsations of Cepheid variable stars7. The angular size of most stars is of the order of one milliarcsecond or less, and to spatially resolve stellar disks and features at this scale requires an optical interferometer using an array of telescopes with baselines on the order of hundreds of metres. We report on the implementation of a stellar intensity interferometry system developed for the four {VERITAS} imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The system was used to measure the angular diameter of the two sub-milliarcsecond stars β Canis Majoris and ϵ Orionis with a precision of greater than 5\%. The system uses an offline approach in which starlight intensity fluctuations that are recorded at each telescope are correlated post observation. The technique can be readily scaled onto tens to hundreds of telescopes, providing a capability that has proven technically challenging to the current generation of optical amplitude interferometry observatories. This work demonstrates the feasibility of performing astrophysical measurements using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays as intensity interferometers and shows the promise for integrating an intensity interferometry system within future observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has garnered tremendous success in a variety of application domains. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and has been applied to most traditional application domains, as well as some new areas that present more opportunities. Different methods have been proposed based on different categories of learning, including supervised, semi-supervised, and un-supervised learning. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance using deep learning when compared to traditional machine learning approaches in the fields of image processing, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, art, medical imaging, medical information processing, robotics and control, bioinformatics, natural language processing, cybersecurity, and many others. This survey presents a brief survey on the advances that have occurred in the area of Deep Learning ({DL}), starting with the Deep Neural Network ({DNN}). The survey goes on to cover Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}), Recurrent Neural Network ({RNN}), including Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) and Gated Recurrent Units ({GRU}), Auto-Encoder ({AE}), Deep Belief Network ({DBN}), Generative Adversarial Network ({GAN}), and Deep Reinforcement Learning ({DRL}). Additionally, we have discussed recent developments, such as advanced variant {DL} techniques based on these {DL} approaches. This work considers most of the papers published after 2012 from when the history of deep learning began. Furthermore, {DL} approaches that have been explored and evaluated in different application domains are also included in this survey. We also included recently developed frameworks, {SDKs}, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating deep learning approaches. There are some surveys that have been published on {DL} using neural networks and a survey on Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). However, those papers have not discussed individual advanced techniques for training large-scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models.},

	abstract = {We present a deep learning-based generative model for the enhancement of partially coherent diffractive images. In lensless coherent diffractive imaging, a highly coherent X-ray illumination is required to image an object at high resolution. Non-ideal experimental conditions result in a partially coherent X-ray illumination, lead to imperfections of coherent diffractive images recorded on a detector, and ultimately limit the capability of lensless coherent diffractive imaging. The previous approaches, relying on the coherence property of illumination, require preliminary experiments or expensive computations. In this article, we propose a generative adversarial network ({GAN}) model to enhance the visibility of fringes in partially coherent diffractive images. Unlike previous approaches, the model is trained to restore the latent sharp features from blurred input images without finding coherence properties of illumination. We demonstrate that the {GAN} model performs well with both coherent diffractive imaging and ptychography. It can be applied to a wide range of imaging techniques relying on phase retrieval of coherent diffraction patterns.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

	abstract = {We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

	abstract = {{MAGIC} is a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes located in the Canary island of La Palma, Spain. During summer 2011 and 2012 it underwent a series of upgrades, involving the exchange of the {MAGIC}-I camera and its trigger system, as well as the upgrade of the readout system of both telescopes. We use observations of the Crab Nebula taken at low and medium zenith angles to assess the key performance parameters of the {MAGIC} stereo system. For low zenith angle observations, the standard trigger threshold of the {MAGIC} telescopes is ∼ 50 {GeV}. The integral sensitivity for point-like sources with Crab Nebula-like spectrum above 220GeV is (0.66 ± 0.03)\% of Crab Nebula flux in 50h of observations. The angular resolution, defined as the σ of a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution, at those energies is ≲ 0.07°, while the energy resolution is 16\%. We also re-evaluate the effect of the systematic uncertainty on the data taken with the {MAGIC} telescopes after the upgrade. We estimate that the systematic uncertainties can be divided in the following components: {\textless} 15\% in energy scale, 11\%–18\% in flux normalization and ± 0.15 for the energy spectrum power-law slope.},

In this work we introduce the conditional version of generative adversarial nets, which can be constructed by simply feeding the data, y, we wish to condition on to both the generator and discriminator. We show that this model can generate {MNIST} digits conditioned on class labels. We also illustrate how this model could be used to learn a multi-modal model, and provide preliminary examples of an application to image tagging in which we demonstrate how this approach can generate descriptive tags which are not part of training labels.},

	abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the {ISBI} challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and {DIC}) we won the {ISBI} cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent {GPU}. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},
